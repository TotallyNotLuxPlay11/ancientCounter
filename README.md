# ancientCounter

This is a fan project meant to make an ancient countdown counter on a set interval based on font that was used in Stargate shows and movies, based on the show's Ancient (Lantean) text format.
The app is C# based and has a gui, its not compiled so an IDE like Rider or Visual Studio is required for future development. This is free and open to fork and use for anyone since I'm not the greatest in C# so I gave up but might return to it one day. 
MADE IN .NET VERSION 9
